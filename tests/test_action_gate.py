"""
The action-conditioning gate.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. tests/test_model.py already asserts three things about the
action path: AdaLN-Zero is the identity at init, an UNZEROED predictor responds
to a changed action embedding, and the action encoder's gradient unsticks on
step 1. All three pass on a model that, once trained, ignores its actions
completely -- measured on the first fully-trained checkpoint, where rolling
`run_right` for 8 macros vs `run_left` for 8 macros moved the predicted latent
0.759 against 18.325 between two real frames the same span apart (ratio 0.041),
and the planner stalled at x=435/3161.

Those tests check the architecture CAN use actions. This one checks a given
checkpoint DOES.
