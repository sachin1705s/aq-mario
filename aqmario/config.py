"""
Central config for AQ-Mario. Everything downstream (data schema, model dims,
eval gates, the stage tracker) reads from here so the stages stay consistent.

Design notes tied to the LeMario postmortem:
- FRAME_SKIP is 2, not 5. A jump arc is ~30 emulator frames; skip-5 gives ~6
  samples per jump and lets SIGReg throw away vertical info because it barely
  helps 1-step prediction. Skip-2 makes y matter for the prediction loss.
- We log RAM-derived state (x, y, scroll, alive) as AUX TARGETS. In the
  aux-loss variant these get small prediction heads; in the pure variant they
  are used only by the eval gates / probes, never in the training loss.

# ---- Targets we are trying to beat (LeMario) --------------------------------
# HOW TO READ mse_*: pred_loss is MSE in a latent space the model chooses its own
# scale for, so the raw number means nothing alone. The encoder ends in
# BatchNorm(affine=False), which pins var(z)=1 per coordinate, so a mean-predictor
# scores exactly 1.0 and gain = 1 - mse. That is why `gain` is the comparable
# column and mse is the convenience one.
#
# AND NEITHER IS VALID WITHOUT eff_dim. A rank-1 latent still has unit variance
# per coordinate after that BN (every coordinate perfectly correlated), so the
# predictor only has to predict ONE SCALAR: measured on the first real dry run,
# pred_loss 0.061 -> gain 0.939, which would "beat" LeMario's 0.455 while eff_dim
# sat at 1.17. Quote gain and eff_dim together or do not quote gain.
# RAW MSE IS NOT COMPARABLE ACROSS LATENT SCALES, and the original targets here
# were. LeMario reports mse_5step 0.07772 AND gain_5step 0.455 together, which
# pins their latent variance at 0.07772/(1-0.455) = 0.1426 (cross-checks: their
# 1-step implies gain 0.903). Ours is exactly 1.0, forced by BN(affine=False).
# Identical predictive quality therefore shows up as a 7.0x larger MSE for us,
# and the original "mse_5step < 0.05" target silently meant gain > 0.95.
# `comparable` marks the columns that survive the scale difference.
