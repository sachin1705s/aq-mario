Stage 2 training loop. Called two ways:

    from aqmario.train import train_jepa      # by methods/jepa.py under `aq train`
    python -m aqmario.train --dry-run         # single shard, proves both losses move

Everything the run needs to be judged by is written to run_dir:
    metrics.jsonl    one row per step — the SAME file `aquin watch ingest` tails
    param_count.json param report, read by the tracker
    dryrun.json      did pred_loss and sigreg_loss actually move

WHY BOTH LOSSES ARE LOGGED SEPARATELY AND NEVER SUMMED IN THE LOG. The two ways
this run dies look identical in the total: sigreg plateauing high and pred_loss
diving to zero both leave `loss` looking "fine-ish" for a few hundred steps. The
diagnosis is only in the split, plus eff_dim.

BF16, NOT FP16. The SIGReg statistic squares a difference of two numbers that
are both near 1 at small t; in fp16 that subtraction loses most of its
significant digits and the gradient turns to noise. bf16 keeps the exponent
range, and the statistic is accumulated in fp32 anyway (sigreg() casts).

    Stage 2's exit check for "does this thing learn, WITHOUT collapsing".

    THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS GATE HAD A HOLE and a real run walked straight
    through it. It asserted only that pred_loss and sigreg_loss "moved", and a
    collapsing run satisfies both: pred_loss 0.975 -> 0.061 (moved), sigreg
    0.030 -> 0.098 (moved), eff_dim 9.96 -> 1.17 (every latent identical). The
    prediction task is trivially solvable by mapping every frame to one point,
    so "the loss went down" is evidence of nothing on its own.

    Three conditions now, and each corresponds to a way the run is actually
    broken:

      learning     pred_loss falls by >5%.
      not collapsed  eff_dim stays above half its own Marchenko-Pastur null.
                   Half, not "near 192": the null at batch B is B*D/(B+D), which
                   is 27 at B=32, so anything phrased in absolute terms is a
                   threshold on the batch size rather than on the model.
      regularised  final sigreg_ratio < 5. Ratio, not raw value, because the raw
                   floor is 0.51914/B.

    sigreg is deliberately NOT required to decrease. It legitimately rises early
    while the encoder is still moving, and demanding a decrease fails healthy runs.
