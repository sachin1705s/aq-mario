"""
The PPO exploration policy — Stage 1's SECOND data track.

Why it exists: the biased random policy tops out at world_x = 1416 of the
flagpole's 3161 (measured on the first 40 episodes). Everything past the first
pipe complex — the pit sequence, the stair, the flagpole approach — is simply
absent from random data. A y-probe R2 measured on that data describes the first
45% of 1-1 and is not comparable to a number measured on the whole level, so
half the dataset comes from a noisy PPO agent that actually gets to the end.

THE PREPROCESSING LIVES HERE, NOT IN THE TRAINING SCRIPT, and that is the whole
point of the module. collect_data.py's --policy ppo calls model.predict() on
whatever it hands over; if that observation is not preprocessed EXACTLY as it
was during PPO training, the policy sees garbage and silently degenerates to
near-random — you get 4000 episodes that took an hour of GPU to produce and are
no better than the free ones. One definition, imported by both sides.

Two alignment details that are easy to get wrong:

* FRAME SKIP MUST MATCH COLLECTION. The PPO env repeats each action for
  CFG.data.frame_skip emulator frames, the same as scripts/collect_data.py. A
  policy trained at skip-4 and replayed at skip-2 holds every jump for half as
  long, which is exactly the vertical behaviour we are collecting for.

* GYMNASIUM, NOT GYM. nes-py speaks the old 4-tuple gym API (which is why
  gym==0.25.2 is pinned); modern stable-baselines3 speaks gymnasium's 5-tuple.
  MarioEnv is the adapter, and it is 30 lines — much less fragile than pinning
  stable-baselines3 back to 1.6.x to meet nes-py where it stands.
