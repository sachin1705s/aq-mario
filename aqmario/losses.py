Stage 2 losses.

    L = MSE(zhat, z_target)
      + sigreg_lambda * SIGReg(z)
      + 0.05*MSE(y_head, y) + 0.05*MSE(s_head, scroll) + 0.02*BCE(dead_head, dies_in_5)

SIGReg is the only thing standing between this run and collapse — there is no
EMA target encoder and no stop-gradient (see model.py). It is the sketched
isotropic-Gaussian regulariser from LeJEPA: push z's one-dimensional marginals
toward N(0,1) along many random directions, and the joint distribution has
nowhere to collapse to.

WHY EPPS-PULLEY AND NOT A MOMENT MATCH. Matching mean and covariance to (0, I)
is a weaker constraint than it looks; Epps-Pulley compares the empirical
CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTION to the Gaussian one along each direction, so it also
sees the radial law, and it is smooth in z (no sorting, no histogram bins),
which Kolmogorov-Smirnov and binned Cramer-von Mises are not.

    T = integral |phi_n(t) - exp(-t^2/2)|^2 exp(-t^2) dt

evaluated by Gauss-Hermite quadrature on `sigreg_knots` nodes. `sigreg_knots`
and `sigreg_projections` in the config are exactly these two: quadrature nodes
per direction, and number of random directions.

WHAT IT ACTUALLY CATCHES, measured at n=384, D=192 against a null of 0.00123:

    all-latents-identical      0.503     410x null
    scale wrong (z * 3)        0.395     321x
    rank-8 collapse            0.313     254x
    heavy radial tail          0.037      30x
    scale mixture              0.021      17x
    anisotropic covariance     0.012      10x
    ---------------------------------------------- blind spots:
    5% outliers at 8 sigma     0.0024      2x
    per-coordinate bimodal     0.0013      1.1x
    unit shell at radius sqrt(D) 0.0014    1.1x

The blind spots are not a bug in the statistic, they are the projection CLT: a
random 1-D projection of a 192-dim distribution is nearly Gaussian unless the
COVARIANCE or the RADIAL law is wrong. Per-coordinate structure is averaged away
by the sketch. So SIGReg is a guarantee against collapse (which is always a rank
or scale failure, and shows up at 10-400x null), NOT a certificate that z is
Gaussian in every respect. Do not claim the latter in the writeup.

THE TABLE ABOVE IS ON RAW LATENTS. In the real model z has just come out of
BatchNorm(affine=False), which pins every coordinate to unit variance for free —
so the "scale wrong" and most of the "rank-8" signal is already gone before
SIGReg sees anything. Measured on a rank-8 latent AFTER that BN, the statistic
reads 10x null, not 254x. That is still unambiguous, and it is the regime the
sweep is calibrated in, but it means the BN and SIGReg are not redundant: BN
fixes the diagonal of the covariance, SIGReg fixes the rest.

AND IT DOES ESCAPE, but only through the BN. Optimising a rank-8 latent as a
free tensor barely moves it (the statistic is nearly flat once the marginals are
unit-variance). Optimising the MAP that produces it, with the gradient flowing
through the BN as it does in the model, works:

    step   0   sigreg 0.0139  (10.0x null)   eff_dim   7.9
    step 100   sigreg 0.0051  ( 3.8x null)   eff_dim  21.5
    step 300   sigreg 0.0021  ( 1.6x null)   eff_dim  52.0
    step 600   sigreg 0.0015  ( 1.1x null)   eff_dim  69.5

This is the single experiment that says the Stage 2 design is sound, and it is
pinned as test_sigreg_escapes_rank_collapse_through_bn.

Gradient norms here are small in absolute terms (~1e-3 for 384x192 latents),
which is why sigreg_lambda is a real knob rather than a formality and why the
sweep spans {0.01, 0.1, 0.5} rather than something tighter.

THE NULL IS NOT ZERO, AND IT DEPENDS ON BATCH SIZE. Under the null,
E|phi_n - phi|^2 = (1 - e^{-t^2})/n exactly, so

    E[T | z ~ N(0,I)] = sqrt(pi) * (1 - 1/sqrt(2)) / n = 0.51914 / n

(verified: predicted/measured within 3% at n = 64..2048). A run at batch 64 with
window 6 has n=384 and therefore FLOORS at ~0.0013 no matter how Gaussian the
encoder gets. Reading raw sigreg_loss across two runs with different batch sizes
is meaningless; `sigreg_ratio = sigreg / sigreg_null(n)` is the comparable
number, and it is what train.py logs alongside it. Ratio ~1 means "Gaussian, at
the resolution this batch size can measure".

One consequence worth knowing: because the floor comes from sampling noise, the
optimiser can push T slightly BELOW 1.0x null by making the batch mildly
repulsive (more evenly spread than iid). That is benign, and it is a second
reason the target is "ratio near 1", not "loss near 0".

Two failure signatures to watch in the curves (aq_watch streams both):
  * sigreg_loss plateaus high        -> encoder cannot reach Gaussian; usually a
                                        trailing LayerNorm somewhere, or lr too low
  * pred_loss -> 0, eff_dim collapses -> collapsing anyway, sigreg_lambda too low
