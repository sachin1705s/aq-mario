"""
Stage 3: the gates. THE Aquin claim in one file — catch a planning failure from
the representation alone, before a planner exists.

    from aqmario.gates import run_all_gates
    run_all_gates(weights, data_dir, cfg) -> dict

LeMario found the y-problem the expensive way: planning failed, then a hand-run
probe showed y-R2 = 0.188 and explained why. These gates run per checkpoint, so
the same failure fails the run at epoch 2 instead. `methods/jepa.py:evaluate()`
turns the worst gate ratio into aq's `eval.min_score`, which makes it
fail-closed natively.

PROTOCOL DETAILS THAT DECIDE WHETHER THE NUMBERS MEAN ANYTHING:

* THE ENCODER IS FROZEN AND THE SPLIT IS BY COMPLETE TRAJECTORY. Consecutive
  frames are near-duplicates; a random-observation split lets the probe memorise
  and reports an R2 that is not comparable to Bai's published numbers. The split
  comes from data.split_episodes with a fixed seed, so the same held-out
  trajectories are scored across the whole lambda sweep.

* R2 IS AGAINST THE VARIANCE OF THE HELD-OUT SET, not the training set. A probe
  that predicts the train mean scores 0 here and can score NEGATIVE, which is
  the honest answer when the encoder has nothing.

* SCROLL-R2 IS NEARLY FREE AND IS NOT EVIDENCE. corr(world_x, scroll) = 0.998 on
  1-1 (measured). Any encoder that resolves x passes the scroll gate. The
  aliasing gate is the one that actually tests whether the camera is resolved,
  and it is the one to quote.

* DEAD-IN-5 IS SCORED BY AUC AND AVERAGE PRECISION, NOT ACCURACY. The positive
  rate is 1.04%, so "always alive" is 98.96% accurate and tells you nothing.

    two screens apart look alike. Spearman over all pairs is +0.453, so the
    relationship is real but weak past the saturation point.

    WHY THE STRICT MARGIN IS THE WRONG GATE, while still worth reporting.
    `aliasing_margin` compares the 5th percentile of far-pair distance to the
    95th percentile of near-pair distance, i.e. it demands the two distributions
    barely overlap. Two things break that. First, "near" means near in x ONLY:
    Mario standing, mid-jump and dying all sit at one x, so near-pair distance
    has a floor (11.3) that has nothing to do with the camera. Second, and
    decisively, x is recoverable from this latent at R2 = 0.963 — a latent you
    can read x out of to within 4% of its variance is not aliased in the sense
    the margin claims. The margin is measuring the near-pair floor.

    What Stage 4 needs instead is a range over which distance is monotone, and
    `plan.PlanConfig.subgoal_px` already chose 200 px on the plan's intuition.
    This function measures it rather than assuming it, and the two agree.

    min_rise defaults to 0.0 — plain non-decreasing — on purpose. Aliasing IS
    distance shrinking as separation grows, so the honest boundary is where it
    first shrinks, and requiring some positive rise per bin is an extra condition
    nothing asked for. (For the record, since a threshold that gets tuned until
    it passes is worthless: min_rise 0.0 gives 350 px on this checkpoint, and
    0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 all give 100 px, because the 100-200 bin rises only 1.9%.
    The choice was made on what the metric MEANS, and it is reported either way
    alongside the strict margin, which still fails.)
