"""
Single source of truth for RAM -> interpretable state.

Imported by BOTH scripts/collect_data.py (logging) and aqmario/gates.py (probe
targets). If training targets and eval probes ever drift apart, every number in
the writeup is meaningless — so there is exactly one definition, here.

WHY CANDIDATES INSTEAD OF CONSTANTS
-----------------------------------
The original handoff's addresses were written from memory of the SMB RAM map.
A wrong address does not crash; it silently corrupts every gate, probe and
planner cost. So each field declares the candidate addresses that are plausible
in the datacrystal map, together with an INVARIANT that a real 60-frame
"walk right" trace must satisfy. scripts/validate_ram.py runs that trace and
reports which candidates hold. You then lock the winner into CHOSEN below.

Until validate_ram.py has been run and CHOSEN confirmed, `validated()` is False
and the Stage 1 tracker will refuse to mark data collection as trustworthy.
