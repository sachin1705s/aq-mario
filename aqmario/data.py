"""
Stage 2 data path: .npz shards on disk -> batched training windows.

Shard layout (written by scripts/collect_data.py):
    frames (T,224,224,3) u8 | actions (T,skip,6) u8 | ep_offsets (n_eps+1,) i64
    world_x/world_y/scroll i32 | alive/power/dies_in_5 u8 | outcome (n_eps,) u8

Three things here are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

1. ACTION ALIGNMENT. collect_data.py appends `actions[i]` BEFORE observing
   `frames[i]` — so actions[i] is the button block that CAUSED frames[i], not
   the one taken from it. A window frames[s..s+W-1] is therefore conditioned on
   actions[s+1..s+W-1]: W-1 transitions, off by one from the naive slice. Get
   this backwards and the predictor is asked to predict the past.

2. WINDOWS NEVER CROSS EPISODES. ep_offsets exists for exactly this reason. A
   window spanning a reset would teach the predictor that Mario teleports.

3. THE SPLIT IS BY WHOLE TRAJECTORY. Bai's protocol (~60 held-out complete
   trajectories). Splitting by observation instead leaks: consecutive frames are
   near-duplicates, so a random-observation split reports a probe R2 that is
   mostly memorisation and is not comparable to LeMario's published numbers.

MEASURED on the first 40 real episodes, and worth knowing before reading any
gate number:
  * corr(world_x, scroll) = 0.998. Scroll is very nearly an affine function of x
    on 1-1, so scroll-R2 > 0.90 is almost FREE once x is encoded. The scroll
    probe is not evidence that the model resolves the camera — the aliasing gate
    is the one that tests that.
  * random-policy world_x tops out at 1416 of the flagpole's 3161. The back half
    of the level is unseen until the PPO track exists, so probe R2 measured on
    random-only data describes the first 45% of 1-1.
  * dies_in_5 is true on 1.04% of observations. Any BCE head on it needs
    pos_weight or it converges to "always alive" (see losses.aux_heads).
