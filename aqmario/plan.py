Stage 4: plan with the world model, and steer it with a feature the SAE found.

    from aqmario.plan import MacroCEM, rollout_cost, steer_predictor
    planner = MacroCEM(model, probes)
    actions = planner.plan(frames, actions_so_far)

TWO DECISIONS FROM THE LeMario POSTMORTEM, both of which are about the optimiser
fighting the problem rather than the model being wrong:

* CATEGORICAL CEM OVER 5 MACRO-ACTIONS, NOT GAUSSIAN CEM OVER 6 BINARY BUTTONS.
  A Gaussian proposal over binary buttons spends most of its mass on button
  combinations that are not reachable and have no dynamics behind them — half of
  LeMario's planning failures were the optimiser, not the world model. The macro
  set in config.MACRO_ACTIONS is 5 things Mario can actually do.

* SUB-GOALS EVERY ~200 PX, NOT ONE LATENT-DISTANCE CALL TO THE FLAGPOLE. Latent
  distance is only trustworthy over the range the aliasing gate certifies. A
  single call spanning 3000 px asks the latent a question the camera-aliasing
  gate says it cannot answer, and the planner will happily walk into it.

THE COST IS PROBE-SCORED, NOT LATENT-DISTANCE-SCORED. `x_progress` comes from the
frozen x-probe applied to the PREDICTED latent, so the planner optimises a
quantity the Stage 3 gates have actually measured the reliability of. A cost
built on raw latent distance is a cost whose units nobody has validated.
